<h3> 1. The Gooonies </h3>
<p> Set in the gorgeous locale of Astoria, Oregon, a group of young friends find a treasure map and embark on an epic adventure to find the missing treasure and save their homes from destruction. </p>
<h3> 2. Overboard.</h3>
<p> Another movie set in Oregon, this one is about a rich woman who loses her memory and ends up being duped into believing she's the poor wife of a local handyman who she wronged. Hilarity ensues as she learns how to take care of 4 rowdy boys and a wild husband. A feel good, romantic comedy for the whole family. (Plus a super cute hound dog for extra good movie bonus points!) </p>
<h3> 3. Crash Landing On You.</h3>
<p> A South Korean romantic drama about a South Korean heiress who accidentally paraglides into North Korea and meets a North Korean army officer. The two fall in love despite the political tensions and cultural differences, leading to a heartwarming and suspenseful story that has captured the hearts of many viewers worldwide.</p>
